# Detailed Accessibility Implementation Plan for Kanji Stroke Order Visualization

## Overview

This plan provides a step-by-step guide to making the Kanji Stroke Order Visualization feature fully accessible, following WCAG guidelines and your coding instructions. It ensures the feature is usable by all users, including those relying on assistive technologies, and is compatible with both desktop and mobile devices.

---

## 1. Semantic Markup

- Use `<figure>` to group the SVG/canvas and its caption.
- Use `<figcaption>` to provide a description, e.g., "Trace the kanji: 漢".
- All interactive controls (play, pause, step, reset) should be `<button>` elements.
- Use `<nav aria-label="Stroke order controls">` to group navigation controls.

---

## 2. Descriptive Alt Text and Labels

- Generate dynamic `alt` text for each SVG, e.g., "Stroke order for 漢".
- All buttons must have `aria-label` or visible text describing their function.
- For canvas-based tracing, provide an `aria-label` describing the activity, e.g., "Canvas for tracing kanji strokes".
- Ensure all ARIA labels and alt text are localizable for future internationalization.

---

## 3. Keyboard Accessibility

- All controls must be reachable and operable via keyboard (Tab, Enter, Space).
- Implement logical tab order for controls.
- Provide visible focus indicators using Tailwind CSS and oklch colors.
- Keyboard shortcuts (e.g., R for reset, Enter for check) should be documented and announced.

---

## 4. Screen Reader Support

- Use ARIA roles and properties to describe the SVG/canvas and controls.
- Use `aria-live="polite"` regions to announce feedback (e.g., "Correct stroke!", "Try again.").
- Ensure all controls have clear, descriptive labels and roles.

---

## 5. Color and Contrast

- Use oklch colors with sufficient contrast for all UI elements and highlights.
- Do not rely on color alone: use shapes, outlines, or patterns to indicate current stroke or feedback.
- Test color contrast using automated tools.

---

## 6. Responsive Design

- Ensure the component and controls scale for all screen sizes.
- SVGs and canvas should be responsive and touch-friendly for mobile and tablet users.
- Controls should be large enough for touch interaction.

---

## 7. Error Handling

- If the SVG or canvas fails to load, display an accessible error message using `role="alert"`.
- Provide fallback text or a link to a text-based stroke order description.
- Log missing or malformed SVGs for monitoring and debugging.

---

## 8. Security

- Validate and sanitize any user input or drawing data to prevent security issues.
- Escape all user-facing feedback messages to prevent XSS.
- Review any third-party JavaScript libraries used for SVG/canvas interaction for vulnerabilities.

---

## 9. Testing

- Use automated accessibility testing tools (axe-core, Lighthouse) in CI.
- Add manual tests with screen readers (VoiceOver, NVDA) and keyboard navigation.
- Include accessibility checks in integration and component tests.
- Test on both desktop and mobile devices.
- Include accessibility regression tests in CI.
- If storing user tracing data, use Ash’s test resources for isolated tests.

---

## 10. Documentation

- Document all accessibility features and keyboard shortcuts in user-facing help or documentation.
- Provide a section in the README or app help page describing accessibility support.
- Add a prompt for user feedback on accessibility and iterate as needed.

---

## 11. Change Logging

- Log all accessibility-related changes in `CHANGELOG.md` with the date, author, and a brief description.
- **Example:**  
  `2025-06-04 (davidwilliams): Improved keyboard navigation and added ARIA labels to KanjiStrokeOrderComponent.`

---

## Next Steps

1. Refactor the KanjiStrokeOrderComponent to use semantic HTML and ARIA attributes.
2. Add dynamic alt text and accessible labels for SVGs, canvas, and controls.
3. Implement and test keyboard navigation, focus management, and screen reader support.
4. Ensure color contrast and non-color cues for all highlights and feedback.
5. Make the component fully responsive and touch-friendly.
6. Add automated and manual accessibility tests, including regression tests.
7. Update documentation to describe accessibility features and shortcuts.
8. Add a mechanism for user accessibility feedback.
9. Log all changes in `CHANGELOG.md`.
