# Implementation Plan for Audio Feedback in Kanji Stroke Order Visualization

## Overview

This plan outlines the steps to add accessible, secure, and testable audio feedback to the Kanji Stroke Order Visualization feature. The implementation will follow your coding, security, testing, and styling instructions.

---

## 1. Audio Asset Preparation

- [ ] Gather or generate audio files for kanji pronunciation.
- [ ] Store audio files in `priv/static/audio/` or set up a secure TTS API.
- [ ] Map each kanji to its corresponding audio file or TTS string.
- [ ] For stroke-by-stroke cues, prepare short audio files or TTS phrases for each stroke.

---

## 2. Component & UI Scaffolding

- [ ] Scaffold audio controls (play, pause, stop, mute) in the `KanjiStrokeOrderComponent`.
- [ ] Use semantic HTML (`<button>`) and ARIA attributes for all controls.
- [ ] Add an `aria-live="polite"` region for playback status updates.
- [ ] Style controls with Tailwind CSS and oklch colors.
- [ ] Ensure all controls are keyboard accessible and have visible focus indicators.

---

## 3. Audio Playback Logic

- [ ] Implement logic to play pronunciation audio on user action.
- [ ] Optionally, play stroke-by-stroke audio cues during animation.
- [ ] Allow users to enable/disable audio feedback.
- [ ] Do not auto-play audio; require explicit user action.

---

## 4. Error Handling

- [ ] Display accessible error messages if audio fails to load or play (`role="alert"`).
- [ ] Provide fallback text or disable audio controls if audio is unavailable.

---

## 5. Security

- [ ] Validate all user input related to audio controls.
- [ ] Only serve audio from trusted, static sources or secure APIs.
- [ ] Escape all user-facing feedback messages.
- [ ] Do not expose sensitive data in audio URLs or logs.

---

## 6. Testing

- [ ] Add unit and integration tests for audio controls and playback.
- [ ] Test keyboard and screen reader accessibility for all audio features.
- [ ] Test audio playback on desktop and mobile devices.
- [ ] Include accessibility regression tests in CI.
- [ ] Use Ashâ€™s test resources if storing user audio preferences.

---

## 7. Documentation

- [ ] Document audio features and controls in user-facing help and accessibility documentation.
- [ ] Provide instructions for enabling/disabling audio and keyboard shortcuts.

---

## 8. Change Logging

- [ ] Log all audio-related changes in `CHANGELOG.md` with the date, author, and a brief description.
- [ ] Use the format:  
  `YYYY-MM-DD (author): <summary of change>`

## Next Steps

1. Add audio files or integrate a TTS API for kanji pronunciation.
2. Scaffold audio controls in the KanjiStrokeOrderComponent with semantic markup and ARIA attributes.
3. Implement stroke-by-stroke audio cues during animation.
4. Ensure all audio controls are accessible and keyboard operable.
5. Add error handling for missing or failed audio.
6. Write unit, integration, and accessibility tests for audio features.
7. Update documentation to describe audio features and controls.
8. Log all changes in `CHANGELOG.md`.
