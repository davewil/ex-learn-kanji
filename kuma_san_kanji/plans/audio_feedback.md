# Detailed Plan for Adding Audio to Kanji Stroke Order Visualization

## Overview

This plan describes how to enhance the Kanji Stroke Order Visualization feature with audio support, improving accessibility and user engagement. Audio will provide pronunciation playback and optional stroke-by-stroke cues, following your coding, security, testing, and styling instructions.

---

## 1. Audio Features

- **Pronunciation Playback:**  
  Add a button to play the kanji’s pronunciation using pre-recorded audio or a TTS (Text-to-Speech) API.
- **Stroke-by-Stroke Audio Cues:**  
  Optionally, play a sound or spoken number as each stroke is animated.
- **Audio Controls:**  
  Provide accessible controls for play, pause, stop, and mute.

---

## 2. Semantic Markup & Accessibility

- Use `<button>` elements for all audio controls, each with a descriptive `aria-label` (e.g., "Play pronunciation", "Mute audio").
- Announce audio playback status using an `aria-live="polite"` region (e.g., "Playing pronunciation for 漢").
- Ensure all controls are keyboard accessible and have visible focus indicators (styled with Tailwind CSS and oklch).
- Allow users to enable/disable audio feedback easily.
- Do not auto-play audio; require explicit user action.

---

## 3. Integration

- Store audio files in `priv/static/audio/` or use a secure TTS API.
- Map each kanji to its corresponding audio file or TTS string.
- For stroke-by-stroke cues, use short audio files or TTS to announce each stroke as it is animated.

---

## 4. Error Handling

- If audio fails to load or play, display an accessible error message (`role="alert"`).
- Provide fallback text or disable the audio button if no audio is available.

---

## 5. Security

- Validate all user input related to audio controls.
- Do not expose sensitive data in audio URLs or logs.
- Only serve audio from trusted, static sources or secure APIs.
- Escape all user-facing feedback messages.

---

## 6. Testing

- Add unit and integration tests for audio controls and playback.
- Test keyboard and screen reader accessibility for all audio features.
- Test audio playback on desktop and mobile devices.
- Include accessibility regression tests in CI.

---

## 7. Documentation

- Document audio features and controls in user-facing help and accessibility documentation.
- Provide instructions for enabling/disabling audio and keyboard shortcuts.

---

## 8. Change Logging

- Log all audio-related changes in `CHANGELOG.md` with the date, author, and a brief description.
- **Example:**  
  `2025-06-04 (davidwilliams): Added audio pronunciation and stroke-by-stroke cues to KanjiStrokeOrderComponent.`

---

## Next Steps

1. Add audio files or integrate a TTS API for kanji pronunciation.
2. Scaffold audio controls in the KanjiStrokeOrderComponent with semantic markup and ARIA attributes.
3. Implement stroke-by-stroke audio cues during animation.
4. Ensure all audio controls are accessible and keyboard operable.
5. Add error handling for missing or failed audio.
6. Write unit, integration, and accessibility tests for audio features.
7. Update documentation to describe audio features and controls.
8. Log all changes in `CHANGELOG.md`.
