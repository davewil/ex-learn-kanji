  - `kanji_test.exs`: Modified to work with pre-seeded database
  - `example_sentence_test.exs`: Fixed to work properly with database constraints
- Properly configured database connection handling in tests:
  - Updated `conn_case.ex` to ensure database sandbox is set up correctly
  - Modified `test_helper.exs` to initialize Ecto sandbox mode
- All tests now pass successfully with the seeded test database

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed compiler warnings by prefixing unused variables with underscore

### Added (Initial Database Seed)

- Seeded development database with initial kanji data including:
  - Basic kanji characters (水, 火, 木, 山, 川, 日, 月, 人)
  - Associated meanings, pronunciations, and example sentences for each kanji
- Set up test database with initial data for consistent testing
- Created script to reset and seed databases (reset_and_seed_dev.exs)
- Added comprehensive tests for:
  - Kanji resource basic operations
  - Meaning resource and relationships
  - Pronunciation resource and relationships
  - ExampleSentence resource and relationships
  - ExploreLive LiveView functionality

### Fixed

  - Comprehensive error handling and progress reporting

### Updated

  - `record_review/3`: Uses `Ash.Changeset.for_update(:record_review)` 
  - `initialize_progress/2`: Uses `Ash.Changeset.for_create(:initialize)`
  - `get_user_stats/1`: Uses `Ash.Query.for_read(:user_stats)`
  - All helper functions updated with proper error handling and Ash API calls

### Security

## June 5, 2025 - Quiz Data Structure Fix

### ✅ QUIZ PROGRESSION BUG FIXED

**Issue**: Quiz answers weren't progressing the quiz due to data structure mismatch between quiz code expectations and actual Kanji resource structure.

**Root Cause**: The quiz system expected kanji data to have direct attributes (`meanings`, `kun_readings`, `on_readings`) but the actual structure uses relationships:

- `meanings` (relationship to Meaning resources)
- `pronunciations` (relationship to Pronunciation resources with `.type` and `.value`)

**Fixes Applied**:

1. **Updated SRS Logic** (`lib/kuma_san_kanji/srs/logic.ex`):
   - Modified `load_kanji_data/1` to load related meanings and pronunciations using `Ash.Query.load([:meanings, :pronunciations])`

2. **Quiz Data Access Fixed** (`lib/kuma_san_kanji_web/live/quiz_live.ex`):
   - Updated `check_answer_correctness/2` to access `meaning_record.meaning` instead of direct `meaning`
   - Updated pronunciation checks to use `pronunciation_record.value` from the `pronunciations` relationship
   - Fixed feedback message functions to use the correct data structure

**Security**: All input validation and sanitization measures remain in place.

**Testing**: Server successfully compiled and started at <http://localhost:4000>, quiz interface is accessible.
