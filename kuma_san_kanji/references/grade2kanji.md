## Educational Context

The Grade 2 kanji build upon the foundation established in Grade 1 by:

1. Introducing more complex concepts and abstract ideas
2. Increasing the average stroke count (many with 8-12 strokes)
3. Expanding vocabulary to describe daily life in more detail
4. Introducing kanji compounds (熟語) that combine multiple characters

## Study Tips

1. **Compare with Grade 1**: Notice connections between previously learned kanji and new ones
2. **Component Analysis**: Many Grade 2 kanji combine elements from Grade 1 kanji
3. **Contextual Learning**: Focus on learning kanji in useful compounds and sentences
4. **Gradual Progression**: These kanji are more complex, so pace your learning appropriately
5. **Radical Awareness**: Pay attention to recurring components that hint at meaning or pronunciation

## Quick Reference

All 160 Grade 2 kanji include:
- Character
- Meanings (primary and secondary)
- Readings (both kun-yomi and on-yomi with romaji)
