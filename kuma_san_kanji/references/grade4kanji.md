## Educational Context

The Grade 4 kanji curriculum builds upon previous years and represents:

1. Introduction to specialized vocabulary in academic fields like science and social studies
2. Higher complexity with many kanji having 10+ strokes
3. More abstract concepts that require deeper conceptual understanding
4. Increased focus on compound words (熟語) that combine multiple kanji
5. Greater emphasis on kanji as tools for expressing complex ideas and relationships
6. Beginning of domain-specific technical vocabulary development

## Study Tips

1. **Connect to Prior Knowledge**: Relate new kanji to previously learned Grade 1-3 kanji
2. **Look for Patterns**: Identify common radicals and components across different kanji
3. **Focus on Compounds**: Learn kanji in context through common compound words
4. **Group by Theme or Radical**: Study related kanji together to reinforce connections
5. **Practice Active Recall**: Test yourself regularly rather than passive review
6. **Use Context-Based Learning**: Practice kanji in sentences and practical applications
7. **Build Radical Awareness**: Understand how radicals provide meaning and pronunciation clues

## Quick Reference
